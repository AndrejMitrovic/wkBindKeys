# wkBindKeys

This is a D [WormKit](http://worms2d.info/WormKit) module,
used to implement key bindings from within the game.

At least on my machine this method of key binding has
considerably less input lag compared to using
[AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/).

**Note:** Currently the key binds are hardcoded. This will soon
be replaced with an `ini` file reader, or something similar.
