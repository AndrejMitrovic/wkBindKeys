# wkBindKeys

This is a D [WormKit](http://worms2d.info/WormKit) module,
used to implement key bindings from within the game.

At least on my machine this method of key binding has
considerably less input lag compared to using
[AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Installation

Install the `wkBindKeys.dll` and `wkBindKeys.ini` files into your `WormsArmageddon` folder.

For example it could be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Worms Armageddon` if you're using Steam.

You can find these files on the [releases] page.

You will also need `madCHook.dll`. You can find it as part of the [WormNat2](https://worms2d.info/WormNAT2) package.
